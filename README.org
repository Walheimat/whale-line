* whale-line.el

This package is my personal Emacs mode-line.

It displays buffer information in two sections. Each section has its
dedicated segments. Segments come in various priorities that will
determine if they are shown. Some are only shown on the selected
window, some are hidden if there isn't enough space (split windows).

** Installation

If you use =straight= or =quelpa=, you know what to do.

If you're on Emacs >29, I recommend using =package-vc-install=.

Alternatively, provided you have Cask, you can install the package
with =make install=.

** Configuration

On enabling =whale-line-mode=, all features in =whale-line-features= will be
required. Afterwards they can be turned on/off by calling
=whale-line-disable-feature= and =whale-line-enable-feature= respectively.
Segments that rely on external packages will not load if they are
missing. Adapt =whale-line-features= accordingly.

** Example Screenshot

Modeline in a split split frame (theme is =kaolin-galaxy=).

The left window is selected and shows:

- file buffer icon using =all-the-icons=
- status (warnings) using =flycheck=
- position in =org= document
- buffer-status (edited)
- file position
- selection (6 lines)
- =global-mode-string=
- minimized minor modes using =minions=
- project
- version control status (unedited)
- =tab-bar-mode= name
- animation

The right window hides segments with low priority.
