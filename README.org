* wal-line.el

This package is my personal Emacs mode-line.

** Configuration

The base mode line has no dependencies. By default all features are
enabled. This includes the =icons= feature which will require
=all-the-icons=.

On requiring the base package, all features in =wal-line-features= will
be required. Afterwards they can be turned on/off by calling
=wal-line-disable-feature= and =wal-line-enable-feature= respectively.
